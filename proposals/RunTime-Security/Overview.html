      This document specifies the runtime and security model of Web Applications.
      It is describing how an application is defined trough an application
      manifest, how it can be installed, updated and packaged. It is also
      specifying how such an application can put in background, put back in
      foreground or waken up.<br>
      Finaly, the document describes the security model for such applications.
      This includes the permission model and the different security rules that
      would apply.

        <h2>Properties</h2>

        <section>
          <h2>Adding new properties to the manifest</h2>

          <p>Any new specification can add new properties to the <a>application
          manifest</a>. Those specifications MUST describe the new properties,
          the expected values and the expected behaviour. Implementations MUST
          implement the basic properties as describe below but SHOULD only
          implement any extented feature if they are implementing those
          specifications.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Basic properties</h2>

        <p>All leaf properties MUST contain a string value unless specified
           otherwise.</p>
        <p>The following properties MUST be part of the <a>application
           manifest</a>: <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>.
           In addition, if <code>locales</code> is part of the <a>application
           manifest</a>, <code>default_locale</code> MUST be part of the <a>
           application manifest</a>. The other properties are optional.</p>

        <ul class="properties">
          <li><dfn id="propdef-name">name</dfn>: The name of the web application
          in the default locale. The name SHOULD not be longer than 128
          characters.</li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-description">description</dfn>: A short
          description of the web application. The description MUST be in the
          default locale. The description SHOULD not be longer than 1024
          characters.</li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-default_locale">default_locale</dfn>: The
          property's value MUST be the top-level name and description's locale.
          </li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-launch_path">launch_path</dfn>: The property's
          value MUST be the path within the <a>application's origin</a> that is loaded
          when the application is launched.</li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-icons">icons</dfn>: A map of icon sizes to URIs of
          the icons (which may be absolute, relative or data URIs). Icons MUST be
          square. Relative URLs MUST use the <a>application manifest</a> URL as
          base URL.</li>

          <li>
            <dfn id="propdef-developer">developer</dfn>: This property describe
            the developer of the application and MUST contain the following
            properties:

            <ul>
              <li><dfn id="propdef-developer-name">name</dfn>: The value MUST
              contain the name of the developer.</li>

              <li><dfn id="propdef-url">url</dfn>: The value MUST contain an URL
              pointing to the developer's website</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <dfn id="propdef-locales">locales</dfn>: The property's value MUST
            contain a map of locale specific overrides of strings contained in
            the <a>application manifest</a>. Each locale key is keyed on a
            locale tag [[!RFC4646]], and contains a sparse representation of the
            manifest. Any field in the <a>locales</a> property SHOULD override
            the corresponding property in a localized user interface. The UA
            MAY ignore some values if localizing the property doesn't appear
            to be legit.<br>
            If the <a>locales</a> property is set, the <a>default_locale</a>
            MUST also be set.
          </li>

<!-- Commented because it is a controversial feature.
          <li><dfn id=
          "propdef-installs_allowed_from">installs_allowed_from</dfn>: An array
          of origins that are allowed to trigger installation of this
          application. This field allows the developer to restrict installation
          of their application to specific sites. If the value is omitted,
          installs are allowed from any site.</li>
-->

          <li>
            <dfn id="propdef-appcache_path">appcache_path</dfn>: The value MUST
            contain the absolute path to the application cache manifest
            [[!OFFLINE-WEBAPPS]].<br>
            When an application is installed, the AppCache manifest will be
            fetched and parsed, and its static assets under the CACHE header
            MUST be cached.
          </li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-version">version</dfn>: The value MUST be a
          string that represents the version of the application. The UA SHOULD
          NOT interpret this value but MAY show it to the user so the auther
          SHOULD use human understandable versions.</dfn>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-screen_size">screen_size</dfn>: This object
          SHOULD contain the <code>min_height</code> and <code>min_width</code>
          properties that describe the minimum height and width (in pixels) the
          application needs in order to render correctly. Those values are only
          hint for the UA and should not be considered as mandatory
          restrictions.</li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-required_features">required_features</dfn>: This
          value MUST be an array containing the mandatory feature set the
          application needs in order to run correctly. If the property is
          missing or the value is an empty array or if the value is invalid, the
          mandatory feature set SHOULD be considered as the empty set.<br>
          <span style='color: red;'>TBD: add a list of features.</span></li>

<!-- Commented because it might hopefully go to the Screen Orientation API spec.
          <li>
            <dfn id="propdef-orientation">orientation</dfn>: This value defines
            the allowed orientations at which the application may be rendered. If
            a value is provided, the runtime MUST ensure that the viewport
            rendering the application will adhere to one of the specified values
            and never orient the application in a direction not specified in this
            property. The default behavior SHOULD be to rotate the viewport at an
            angle that best fits the orientation of the device, and MUST change
            as the user spatially rotates the device. The value MUST be an
            array containing one or more of the following string values
            (duplicates SHOULD be ignored):

            <ul>
              <li><dfn id=
              "propdef-orientation-portrait-primary">portrait-primary</dfn>:
              Locked to a single portrait direction. If the device has an obvious
              primary orientation in portrait mode, this is that orientation. If
              there is no obvious primary orientation due to landscape being the
              primary orientation for the device, this is the orientation if
              rotating the device 90 degrees clock-wise from the primary
              landscape mode.</li>

              <li><dfn id=
              "propdef-orientation-landscape-primary">landscape-primary</dfn>:
              Locked to a single landscape direction. If the device has an
              obvious primary orientation in landscape mode, this is that
              orientation. If there is no obvious landscape orientation due to
              portrait being the primary orientation for the device, this is the
              orientation if rotating the device 90 degrees clock-wise from the
              primary portrait mode.</li>

              <li>
                <dfn id=
                "propdef-orientation-portrait-secondary">portrait-secondary</dfn>:
                The portrait mode opposite of <a>portrait-primary</a>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <dfn id=

                The landscape mode opposite of <a>landscape-primary</a>.
              </li>

              <li><dfn id="propdef-orientation-portrait">portrait</dfn>:
              Equivalent to
              <code>["portrait-primary", "portrait-secondary"]</code>.</li>

              <li><dfn id="propdef-orientation-landscape">landscape</dfn>:
              Equivalent to
              <code>["landscape-primary", "landscape-secondary"]</code>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
-->

          <li><dfn id="propdef-fullscreen">fullscreen</dfn>: This value MUST be
          set to either <dfn>true</dfn> or <dfn>false</dfn> to describe whether
          the runtime should launch the application in fullscreen mode.</li>

          <li><dfn id='propdef-relnotes'>relNotes</dfn>: This property's value
          MUST contain a map associating an application's version with a string
          describing the changes between that version and the previous one.</li>

          <li><dfn id="propdef-permisssions">permissions</dfn>: This value
          consists of a set of permissions that the application needs. An
          application SHOULD list every API that is considered to require user
          permission in this field. Usage of an API without a corresponding
          entry in the manifest SHOULD fail. The field is an object, with each
          property name specifying a single permission, and object containing
          the following fields:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <dfn id="propdef-permissions-desc">description</dfn>: Contains
                a human readable string specifying the intent behind requesting
                use of this API. This property is mandatory.
              </li>
              <li>
                <dfn id="propdef-permissions-access">access</dfn>: Contains a
                a string specifying the type of access required for this
                permission. This field is mandatory for a certain subset of
                permissions, and MUST be one of <dfn>read</dfn>,
                <dfn>readwrite</dfn>, <dfn>readcreate</dfn>, or
                <dfn>createonly</dfn>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each specification MUST specify the new permissions that would be
            required to use the feature it is defining.</p>
          </li>

<!-- Commented because it should go to the Web Intents/Web Activities spec.
          <li><dfn id="propdef-activities">activities</dfn>: This value specifies
          a set of
          <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebActivities">WebActivities</a>
          that this app supports. Each property in this value is a discrete
          activity whose name matches the property name. Activity names are
          free-form text, and each activity is represented by an object. This
          object MUST contain the following property:

          <ul>
            <li><dfn id="propdef-activities-href">href</dfn>: When another app
            or web page initiates an activity that is supported by this app, if
            this app is chosen to perform the activity, this page will be opened
            in the manner specified by the <dfn>disposition</dfn> property. The
            manner in which a particular app is chosen to perform an activity is
            out of scope for this specification.</li>
          </ul>

          An activity object MAY also contain the following properties:

          <ul>
            <li><dfn id="propdef-activites-disposition">disposition</dfn>: This
            value specifies how the page specified in <dfn>href</dfn> is presented
            when an activity is invoked. The value, if specified, MUST be one of
            the following (if omitted, defaults to <dfn>window</dfn>):
              <ul>
                <li><dfn id="propdef-activities-disposition-window">window</dfn>:
                The page handling the activity is opened in a new "window" (on a
                mobile device, for example, this view will replace the original
                app that requested the activity). The page MUST call
                <code>navigator.setMessageHandler</code> for each activity it
                supports and subsequently execute the activity for which it
                receives a message. Further, if the activity requires a return
                value, the page MUST call <code>activity.postResult</code> or
                <code>activity.postError</code> (where <code>activity</code> is
                the first argument provided to the function specified by
                <code>setMessageHandler</code>) as appropriate. These functions
                are specified in greater details in the WebActivities
                document.</li>

                <li><dfn id="propdef-activities-disposition-inline">inline</dfn>:
                The page handling the activity will open in an overlay (on a
                mobile device, for example, this will be rendered in a popup over
                the original app that requested the activity). Subsequent behavior
                is exactly the same as if the disposition were
                <dfn>window</dfn>.</li>
              </ul>

            <li><dfn id="propdef-activities-filters">filters</dfn>:
            <i>OPTIONAL</i>. This value is a dictionary, each property of which
            specified a particular filter. These filters will be applied while
            determining apps suitable for handling a given activity. Filter names
            are free-form text, but their values MUST be either a string or an
            array of strings (the exact type depends on the filter).</li>

      <h2>Packaged applications</h2>

      <p>A <dfn>packaged application</dfn> is an application that is
      self-contained in a container. All resources that are commonly used by the
      application SHOULD be available in the container.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>hosted application</dfn> is an application that is not a
      <a>packaged application</a></p>

      <section class="informative">

        <h2>Use cases</h2>

        <p>A <a>packaged application</a> would be useful in a few situations,
        amongst them:
        <ul>
          <li>If a marketplace wants to guarantee that an application is safe,
          it allows it to review the application codes and makes sure that all
          permissions granted can't be used outside of the reviewed code. In
          addition, it forces, by design, that any update will go trough the
          same review process.</li>
          <li>Some developers might want to develop for the Web Platform without
          investing in a server infrastructure. Any client-side only
          applications written on top of the Web Platform will be able to be
          very easily distributed that way.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2>Package format</h2>

        <p>An <a>application manifest</a> for the application MUST be present at
        the root of the container.</p>

        <p>The container of a <a>packaged application</a> MUST be a ZIP file.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>URI of a packaged file</h2>

        <p>A file contained in a <a>packaged application</a> MUST have an URI
        with the following rules:
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>scheme</code> of the URI MUST be <i>app</i>.</li>
          <li>The <code>authority</code> of the URI MUST be an identifier unique
          for each applications. That means, two files from different
          applications can't share the same <code>authority</code> but two files
          from the same application will.</li>
          <li>The <code>path</code> of the URI MUST be the file name.</li>
          <li>Any other parts of the URI MUST be empty.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>For more information about URI's, refer to [[!RFC3986]].</p>

        <p>
        For example, the URI of <i>index.html</i> from an application can be:
        <i>app://e35b8412-7451-46e7-ab29-0cee24fd486a/index.html</i>.
        </p>

        <p>The URI of a packaged file is defined such as two files from the same
        <a>packaged application</a> MUST share the same origin.<br>
        A file from a <a>packaged application</a> and any other resource outside
        of this application (an application or not, packaged or not) MUST not
        share the same origin. [[!ORIGIN]]</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Manifest</h2>

        <p>A <a>packaged application</a> MUST have a copy of its <a>application
        manifest</a> outside of the package so it can be used for installation
        and updates purposes. As a consequence, that copy of the <a>application
        manifest</a> can be reduced to only a few properties: <a>name</a>,
        <a>version</a> and <a>relNotes</a>. In addition, a new property can be
        used only in the content a packaged <a>application manifest<a>: <dfn
        id='prop-package'>package</dfn> that SHOULD contain an object with the
        following properties:
        <ul>
          <li><dfn id='prop-package-url'>url</dfn>: this property MUST contain
          the URL of the package related to that <a>application manifest</a>.
          <br>
          When installing or updating a <a>packaged application</a> from an
          <a>application manifest</a>, the UA MUST always use the manifest
          inside the package as soon as the package is found.</li>
          <li><dfn id='prop-package-size'>size</dfn>: the property SHOULD
          contain the size of the package in kylo bytes.</li>
          <li><dfn id='prop-package-sha256'>sha256</dfn>: this property SHOULD
          contain the SHA256 checksum of the package and SHOULD be used by the
          UA to verify the integrity of the downloaded package.</li>

      <h2>Updates</h2>

      <p>An application SHOULD advertise an update by updating its
      <a>application manifest</a>.</p>

      <p>The UA SHOULD regularly check if the <a>application manifest</a> of
      installed applications has not been updated. To know if the file has been
      updated, HTTP semantics apply.</p>

      <p>For <a>package applications</a>, both <a>application manifest</a>s
      (outside and inside the package) SHOULD be updated. However, the
      <a>application manifest</a> inside the package SHOULD always be checked to
      make sure the update (or the install) is genuine.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data isolation</h2>

      <p>In the context of a running application, all usual rules for data
      isolation MUST apply: same-origin policy, same-domain policy, or whatever
      is used. However, between two applications, those rules no longer apply.
      Two applications MUST be fully isolated from each other in the sense that
      they SHOULD NOT be able to access data from each other. For example, if
      App1 accesses <i>http://example.org</i> and gets a cookie from it, App2
      should not be able to see that cookie when accessing
      <i>http://example.org</i> even if the usual cookie sharing policy should
      allow this to happen.</p>

      <p>This isolation SHOULD apply for all data storage like <i>cookies</i>,
      <i>localStorage</i>, <i>IndexedDB</i>, <i>app cache</i> and any other Web
      Platform mechanism that allows to store data and doesn't explicitly opts
      out from the application data isolation.<br>
      The isolation SHOULD also apply to UA specifics data storage. For example,
      any permission granted or denied to a host/origin/domain should be
      isolated per-application or auto-fill and autocompletion features for
      forms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Navigation</h2>

      <p>Depending on the user interface around the application context,
      navigating outside the <a>application's origin</a> might lock the user out
      of the application. To prevent that, the UA SHOULD NOT allow navigation
      out of the <a>application's origin</a>, unless the origin is specified in
      the following <a>application manifest</a> property:
      <ul>
        <li><dfn id='prop-allow-navigation'>allow-navigation</dfn>: the property
        SHOULD contain an array of origins that can be navigated to from the
        application.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>If the application tries to navigate to an unauthorized origin, the UA
      SHOULD open the link in a regular but distinct browsing context.</p>

      <h2>System Messages</h2>

      <todo>
        TODO: We might want to have something describing how an application goes
        inactive, get killed and everything to have a better description of
        system messages.

        TODO: there is no notion of multi-page applications in this descirption
        of system messages. We do not handle system messages that are registered
        on another page.
      </todo>

      <p><i>System Messages</i> are events sent by the system to an application
      which has registered for it before. Those events are different from DOM
      events in the sense that they are always originated by the system and that
      if the targeted application isn't currently running, it will be started.
      <br>
      In addition, un-handled messages will stay in a queue.</p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Use cases</h2>

        <p>Some applications might be interested in getting some events even if
        they are not running and want to be woken up if such events is sent
        while they are asleep.<br>
        In addition, when the application is being woken, it needs to know as
        soon as possible why it has been disturbed to be able to show the
        appropriate interface.<br>
        Finally, the capability of being woken should be transparent to the
        application.</p>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>

        <p>The <dfn>type of system message</dfn> identifies a category of system
        messages.<br>
        Application are be able to register and handle system messages based
        on their types. There is no exhaustive list of system messages type. Any
        specification can create a new type of system message.</p>

        <p>Each application has a <dfn>pool of messages</dfn> for each <a>type
        of system message</a>. Everytime a system message is sent to an
        application, if there is no handler for that message's type, the UA MUST
        add the message to the pool of messages used for that type.<br>
        The UA MAY, for memory optimization, discard old messages if the pool
        becomes too big or if the messages are too old.

        <p>When a UA is required to <dfn>fire a system message</dfn> of a given
        type, it has to do one of these actions:
        <ul>
          <li>If the application is running and a handler is defined, the UA

      <h2>Permissions</h2>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Use cases</h2>

        <p>Some API might allow the application to access sensitive parts of the
        hardware or sensitive information. To prevent applications to access
        them, some APIs might require one or more permissions. For example, for
        an application to be allowed to access your geolocation information, it
        has to be granted the <i>geolocation</i> permission.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Permission declaration</h2>

        <p>An application SHOULD define all permissions it is going to use in
        the <a>application manifest</a>. The UA MAY automatically grant some
        permissions at install-time or ask the user to grant some applications.
        However, MAY, in addition or alternatively, ask the user to grant
        permissions at run-time.</p>

        <p>The user MUST be able to revoke a granted permission or grant a
        denied permission at any time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Basic Permissions</h2>

        <p>Specifications are expected to declare the permissions they will
        require for their feature to work. Altough, some basic permissions can't
        really go into a specific specification or a related to specifications
        that might be harder to change.</p>

        <p>Thus, this specification is defining the following permissions:</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Permission Name</th>

        <h2>Trusted applications</h2>

        <section class="informative">
          <h2>Use cases</h2>

          <p>Any application can be compromised. It just depends on how much
          effort the attacker wants to provide and how much efforts the author
          wants to dedicate making its application more secure. With an
          interesting enough outcome, attackers could easily double their
          efforts to beat the security in place. For example, an API allowing to
          send SMS, if it can be manipulated by the evil persons, could be used
          to send premium SMS and steal money from the users.</p>

          <p>With a simple permission system, users could be tricked to install
          the application and accept to grant the application the relevant
          permissions. These kind of attacks are proven to be efficient.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Chain of trust</h2>

          <p>An application is said to be a <dfn>trusted application</dfn> if
          the origin installing the application is trusted by the UA and the
          origin installing the application consider the application as
          trusty.</p>

          <p>A UA SHOULD have the public key of all installation origin it is
          considering trusted.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Marking an application trusted</h2>

          <p>A <a>hosted application</a> MUST be recognized as marked trusted by
          the installation origin if the <a>application manifest</a> is signed
          by the installation origin's private key.</p>

          <p>A <a>packaged application</a> MUST be recognized as marked trusted
          by the installation origin if the package is signed by the
          installation origin's private key.</a>

          <p>In both cases, the application SHOULD be considered as trusted by
          the UA if the UA considers the installation origin as trusted,
          following the chain of trust mentioned above.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="informative">
          <h2>Security considerations</h2>

          <p>UA should keep in mind that a signed package is way more secure
          than a signed manifest. A correctly signed package can only be
          compromised if the private key has been compromised or the
          cryptographic algorithm. A UA should not trust an installation origin
          if it does not trust its ability to keep safe its private key.</p>

          <p>On the other hands, a signed manifest only proves that the
          application is genuinly trusted (if the private key was not
          compromised nor the cryptographic algorithm). Anything else can be
          compromised given that it lives in the Internet. There is no need to
          list all possible attacks.</p>

          <p>An important difference between a <a>packaged application</a> and a
          <a>hosted application</a> is the ability to review the code. Any
          permission granted to a <a>packaged application</a> will be granted to
          the code inside the package only. That means trusting such application
          is way easier after a code review, for example.</p>

          <p>However, code review for <a>packaged application</a>s could be
          avoided if the installation origin trusts enough an application
          developer. Such developer could get all its <a>packaged
          application</a>s trusted without too much risk for the users.<br>
          The same thing colud be done for <a>hosted application</a> except that
          it would be recommended to make sure that the developer has strong
          server security or would not risk any security flaw on their servers.

          <h2>CSP Policy</h2>

          <section class="note">
            The following sub-section assumes that a <a>trusted application</a>
            can only be a <a>packaged application</a>. This needs to be updated.
          </section>

          <p>The following CSP policy MUST apply to all <a>trusted
          application</a>s [[!CSP]]:<br></p>

          <p><code>default-src *; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
          style-src 'self'</code></p>

          <p>This puts the following restrictions on web pages part of a
          <a>trusted application</a>:
          <ul>
            <li>Scripts can only be loaded from the package;</li>
            <li>Scripts can not use data:-URIs;</li>
            <li>Inline scripts can not be used;</li>
            <li>eval() can not be used. Neither can eval-like functions like
            setTimeout or "new Function". setTimeout can still be used as long
            as the first argument is a Function object rather than a string;<il>
            <li>onXXX attributes can't be used in the markup of pages. However,
            using the associated <a>EventHandler</a> is doable. For example:
            myElement.onXXX = someFunction;<li>
            <li>&lt;object&gt;, &lt;embed&gt; and &lt;applet&gt; are fully
            disabled. In other words, plugins won't work at all. Including
            flash.</li>
            <li>CSS can only be loaded from the package. Inline CSS is
            however allowed.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>This does not restrict any of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;iframe&gt;s can still point to any URL;</li>
            <li>Images can still be loaded from anywhere. Including when loaded
            using an &lt;img&gt; element, when using CSS background images or
            when using other types of CSS images;</li>
            <li>Media (audio and video) can still be loaded from anywhere;</li>
            <li>Network connections can still be opened anywhere using
            data-centric APIs like XMLHttpRequest or WebSocket.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>There is no way for <a>trusted application</a>s to relax this
          policy.</p>

      <h2>Application life-cycle</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Application states</h2>

        <p>At any time, an application MUST be in one of the following states:
        <a>running</a>, <a>paused</a>, <a>terminated</a>.</p>

        <p>An application is <dfn>running</dfn> when it has been launched by the
        UA and has not been put in <a>paused</a>. A <a>running</a> application
        can transition to <a>paused</a> or <a>terminated</a> states.</p>

        <p>If a <a>running</a> application transitions to a
        <a>paused</a> state, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
        <code>pause</code> on the <a>Application</a> object before switching its
        state.</p>

        <p>If a <a>running</a> application transitions to a <a>terminated</a>
        state, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>terminate</code>
        on the <a>Application</a> object before shutting down the application.
        </p>

        <p>An application is <dfn>paused</dfn> when the UA stops the execution
        of an application without terminating it. A <a>paused</a> application
        SHOULD have all its scripts no longer running, such as rendering,
        parsing, processing media files and any action that requires CPU and
        memory or would distract the user. A <a>paused</a> application can
        transition to <a>running</a> or <a>terminated</a> states.

        <p>If a <a>paused</a> application transitions to a <a>running</a> state,
        the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>resume</code> on the
        <a>Application</a> object after changing its state.</p>

        <p>An application is <dfn>terminated</dfn> when the application has been
        stopped and is no longer loaded in the system. The state of a
        <a>terminated</a> application can only be changed to
        <a>running</a> if the application is launched again.</p>

        <p>If a <a>terminated</a> application transitions to a <a>running<a>
        state, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>launch</code>
        on the <a>Application</a> object after the main browsing context is
        created but before the <code>load</code> and <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>
        events are fired.</p>
      </section>

      <section class='issue'>
          <p>The specification currently assumes that one will save important
          when paused so there is no terminate event when transitionning from
          pause to terminate.</p>
      </section>

      <section class='issue'>
      <p>Do we have real use cases for <code>launch</code>?<br>
         Is firing before <code>load</code> a hard thing to do?</p>

        <h2>Consequences of visibility</h2>

        <p>While an application is running, it can be part or fully hidden. The
        visibility events described in [[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]] MUST be sent when
        the visibility status of the application changes.</p>

        <p>In addition, when the application becomes fully hidden, the UA MAY
        put the application in a <a>paused</a> state.</p>

      <h2><a>DOMRequest</a> interface</h2>

      <section class="note">
        <p>The <a>DOMRequest</a> interface is temporarily hosted by this
          specification. The <i>Runtime and Security Model for Web Applications
          </i> specificaton doesn't plan to keep that guest for ever, this is
          why it is currently staying in an appendix.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Use cases</h2>

        <p>Some methods want to return a value or do an action but can't do it
        synchronously, most of the time for performance reasons. In that case,
        most of those methods will use a callback mechanism to inform the caller
        of the success or the failure of the action.<br>
        However, this callback mechanism makes the code barely readable and
        there is no common pattern used by all API in the Web Platform.<br>
        <a>DOMRequest</a> intend to be used instead of those callbacks to make
        those APIs more developer-friendly and help code readability.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Definition</h2>

        <p>The <a>DOMRequest</a> interface is intented to be used by
        asynchronous methods that want to return something after performing an
        action or simply want to inform the caller that the action is done.<br>
        It returned request can also be used to inform that an error happened
        during the operation.</p>

        <p><a>A <a>DOMRequest</a> has three state. It is whether
        <code>pending</code>, <code>success</code> or <code>error</code>.<br>
        The initial state of a <a>DOMRequest</a> MUST be <code>pending</code>.
        <br>
        If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives a <a>success message</a> while in the
        <code>pending</code> state, its state MUST change to
        <code>success</code> and SHOULD NOT change afterward.<br>
        If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives an <a>error message</a> while in the
        <code>pending</code> state, its state MUST change to <code>error</code>
        and SHOULD NOT change afterward.<br>
        If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives a <a>success message</a> or an
        <a>error message</a> while not in the <code>pending</code> state, the
        message MUST be ignored.</p>

        <p>A <dfn>success message</dfn> SHOULD be sent to the <a>DOMRequest</a>
        when the operation is successfuly terminated. The message MAY contain a
        value which MUST be used by the <code>result</code> attribute. If the
        message does not contain a value, <i>null</i> MUST be used instead.</p>

        <p>As soon as a <a>success message</a> is received,
        <code>readyState</code> MUST return <code>done</code>,
        <code>result</code> MUST return the received value or <i>null</i> as
        explained above and the object MUST NOT change its state and MUST,
        therefore, ignore all following <a>success message</a> and
        <a>error message</a>.<br>
        Finally, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
        <code>success</code> on the object</p>

        <p>An <dfn>error message</dfn> SHOULD be sent to the <a>DOMRequest</a>
        when the operation has failed. The message MAY contain a value which
        MUST be a <a>DOMError</a> object and MUST be used by the
        <code>error</code> attribute. If the message does not contain a value,
        the UA SHOULD find the most appropriate <a>DOMError</a> that represents
        the failure.</p>

        <p>As soon as an <a>error message</a> is received,
        <code>readyState</code> MUST return <code>done</code>,
        <code>error</code> MUST return the received value the most appropriate
        error value as explained above and the object MUST NOT change its state
        and MUST, therefore, ignore all following <a>success message</a> and
        <a>error message</a>.<br>
        Finally, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>error</code>
        on the object.</p>
