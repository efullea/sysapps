      This document defines the secuirty requirements for <em>system 
      applications</em>, a class of web application which has access to APIs 
      not made available by a normal web browser.
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document defines the security requirements for system applications. 
        System applications are web applications which require stronger interaction with
        the host platform compared to web pages and are most closely
        comparable to native applications [[SYSAPPSCHARTER]].  System applications enjoy
        extra privileges and are able to access APIs which are not available to web
        applications running in the browser.  They are therefore not bound by the
        existing browser security model [[Zalewski2009]].  This document defines a set of
        security requirements which cover application packaging, authenticity, installation,
        provenance, access control, runtime restrictions and monitoring interfaces.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This document has been developed as part of a standardisation process
        in order to enable web applications to be functional equals to native
        applications.
      </p>
      
      <p>  
        At present, most web applications run in a browser context which is
        intentionally isolated from the underlying operating system.  This allows users
        (in theory) to visit web pages without security concerns as a malicious
        browser-based application is limited in its ability to compromise the user's
        security and privacy requirements.  However, this also means that browser-based
        applications cannot perform functions that require access to
        potentially-dangerous parts of the underlying platform.  For example: deleting
        or changing contacts from an address book, sending SMS, or making outgoing
        telephone calls.  To support such functions, system applications must be run in
        a context outside of the web browser and new requirements must be placed upon
        them to maintain security.  This document defines those new requirements and
        suggests some technical measures for enforcing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for <em>standardising</em> a security model is to enable
        potential interoperability of system applications and to produce a set
        of 'best practice' guidelines for implementors of system application
        platforms.  This document may be used by application developers to 
        understand the constraints placed on system applications and the reason
        for certain design choices.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Document Scope</h3>
      <p>
        This document defines the requirements for a new security model and does not define any
        specific APIs.  The scope of this document is any element that a system
        application may interact with and the execution environment, although the
        requirements and threats may include more diverse assets and considerations. 
        This document may make assertions around the platform implementing a
        system application runtime environment in order to dictate expected
        features.  As boundary objects, the following non-exhaustive list of things are
        <em>not</em> within scope of this document:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Default API access control rules.</li>
        <li>API-specific access control rules or permissioning interfaces.</li>
        <li>An exhaustive set of API permissions.  <em>Some</em> API permissions may
            be defined, however.</li>
        <li>How application stores review or manage applications.</li>
        <li>Digital rights management for system application content.</li>
        <li>Side channel attacks on system applications.</li>
        <li>Platform vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Implementation details of secure storage or disk encryption 
            provided by a conformant system application platform.</li>
        <li>Fingerprinting of users through system applications.</li>
        <li>Invasive government monitoring of citizens through system 
            applications.</li>
        <li>Modification to trusted components in the platform such as the 
            system application renderer process.</li>
        <li>The runtime security of web pages as processed by a web browser.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Primarily, this document will define:     
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements on how system applications should be packaged and 
            signed.</li>
        <li>System application lifecycle events including installation, update 
            and uninstallation.</li>
        <li>Access control requirements for system applications using APIs or 
            resources.</li>
        <li>Constraints placed on system application execution at runtime.</li>
        <li>Requirements on system applications so that they can potentially be 
            monitored and interoperate with the rest of the device.</li>
      </ul>      
      
      <h3>System Assets and Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        This specification assumes a system with some of the following assets
        and stakeholders.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>User</em>.  The person who uses a device running a conformant 
            platform.  This specification does not define whether this user is 
            the owner of the platform.</li>
        <li><em>Application author / developer</em>.  The person or team who 
            created a system application</li>
        <li><em>Device manufacturer</em>.</li>
        <li><em>Network operator</em>.  In some contexts, particularly mobile 
            devices, an operator will exist who provides network access.</li>        
        <li><em>Application distributor</em>.  The entity responsible for 
            distributing an application, e.g. the owner and manager of an app 
            store.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This document is primarily <em>informative</em> in that it does not 
        define detailed standards to which a product must comply for 
        interoperability.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>The following terms are used throughout this document.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Device owners</em>. One or more stakeholders who has a level of ownership in the device.  This may include the user, operator and device manufacturer.  The owners are defined in a strict hierarchy such that a more privileged owner may override a less privileged owner.</li>
        <li><em>Device</em>.  The device running a conformant system application execution environment.  A user may have several devices.</li>
        <li><em>Execution environment</em>.  The system application platform, also described in this document as a <em>runtime</em>, responsible for controlling and supporting the system application and providing it with access to APIs.</li>
        <li><em>Network</em>.  The network connection(s) used by system applications.</li>
        <li><em>Application</em>.  For the rest of this document, the word 'application' refers to a system application.</li>
        <li><em>App Package</em>.  The downloaded content used to install the application.</li>
        <li><em>App Manifest</em>.  A configuration document defined by the application containing metadata and the set of permissions that the application requires.</li>
        <li><em>App Instance</em>.  The runtime instance of an application.</li>
        <li><em>App Store</em>.  An entity who may be the source of applications and provide additional signing or assurance.</li>      
        <li><em>Side-loading</em>.  The installation of an application through a channel out side of a distributor or app store.  Most commonly through downloading an application package and installing it from disk.</li>
        <li><em>Malware</em>.  Malicious software, in this context a malicious system application with a primary aim which violates the end user's security or privacy requirements.</li>
        <li><em>Greyware</em>.  Software with a primary purpose that is aligned to the users expectations but is also bundled with some form of functionality (advertising, monitoring, etc) that violates the user's privacy requirements.</li>       
        <li><em>Policy</em>.  A set of rules governing system applications or the system application environment.  This does not have to correspond to a particular language and may be implemented in any way (policy file, credentials, etc) so long as it allows for interoperability.</li> 
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>System Application Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        System applications are required to be able to do the following things.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Alarm API to create alarms.</li>
        <li>Use the Contacts API to  add, remove and edit contacts.</li>
        <li>Use the Messaging API to send, receive and view SMS.</li>
        <li>Use the Telephony API to dial a number, pick up a call, route to voicemail, access the call log.</li>
        <li>Use the Raw Sockets API to create, manipulate and listen for low-level TCP and UDP connections.</li>

        <li>Communicate with web servers and use online resources.</li>
        <li>Express the permissions they request for accessing APIs.</li>
        <li>Store data persistently through File APIs, both within a single 
            application's sandboxed storage area and files on the rest of the 
            system if permitted.</li>

        Other requirements on a system application runtime include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The owner, manufacturer or service provider of a device may install
            system applications and remove them.</li>
        <li>Other platform entities such as the operating system or a native
            application should be able to manage the permissions granted to
            system applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Threat Model</h2>
      <p>
        In order to define the security considerations and controls required by
        system applications the following threat model is assumed.  This is
        not intended to be exhaustive: the specific context in which a system
        application is run and the device in question may have additional
        considerations.  This list is drawn from related academic literature
        and systems (TODO: Reference).
      </p>
      <p>
        The threat from Malware is repeated several times in this list in order
        to define the various motivations and potential harm caused by a 
        malicious application.  However, this should not be read to imply that
        malware is necessarily the most important threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This threat model is highly subjective considering the vast range of
        environments in which system applications may be applied.  In 
        particular, as system applications may exist on a range of device 
        form-factors with different likelihood for physical loss and operating 
        systems with different malware expectations.  Furthermore, the 'impact' 
        is currently based purely on users not on other stakeholders.  As such 
        the 'impact' and 'likelihood' values should not be given too much 
        importance.

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>
        From this list of threats the following requirements can be elicited:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>System applications must, by default, be isolated from the rest of the system and other applications.</li>
        <li>System applications must communicate securely with authenticated endpoints to avoid content injection.  This implies that system applications must themselves be identifiable, and that the system application runtime must be able to authenticate all remote and local endpoints.</li> 
        <li>System applications must implement a least-privilege access control to limit the impact of malware and should be sufficiently configurable to allow greyware to be constrained if a user wishes to do so.</li>
        <li>Least privilege access control must include access to remote sources, particularly for loading scripts and other content.</li>
        <li>System applications and their activities must be visible and/or auditable to end users to mitigate risks of spyware</li>
        <li>Applications from unauthenticated sources should be constrained by default as the impact of malware is potentially high.</li>
        <li>The threat of code injection from remote servers is sufficient that steps should be taken to guarantee the integrity of all remote inputs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Application Packaging and Signing</h2>
      <p>
        A system application SHALL consist of a downloadable archive containing
        a manifest file and signatures.  It MAY contain application content.  One
        example of a conformant application package is a Widget [[WIDGETS]].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Application Installation, Provenance and Update</h2>
      
      <h3>Installation</h3>
      <p>
        System applications MUST be installed before they can be executed.
      </p>
      <p>  
        System applications MAY be installed by any device owner.  System 
        applications MAY be installed by the operating system of a device when
        it is first installed.
      </p>
      <p>  
        System application MAY be installed by the user of the device.  The 
        installation of a system application by a user MUST involve user 
        interaction and MUST be the result of an action triggered by the user's
        explicit intent to install the application.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The party responsible for installing an application MUST be recorded by
        the execution environment.  The distributor of an application (and 
        whether the application was side-loaded) MUST be recorded by the 
        execution environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The execution environment SHALL reject invalid application signatures.  
        It SHALL by default disable applications with no signature or with 
        signatures from entities with unrecoginsed root certificates.  However, 
        the exection environment MAY allow signatures from entities with an 
        unrecognised root certificate if a device owner explicitly permits 
        this.  The execution environment MAY 
        define a policy regarding whether an application is permitted to be 
        installed depending on the signatures accompanying the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The execution environment SHALL provide an interoperable mechanism allowing device 
        owners to add and remove certificate authority root
        certificates.  This mechanism MAY be restricted to only certain 
        device owners based on a policy set by a more privileged device owner.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Update</h3>      
      <p>
        System applications SHALL have a well-defined update process that SHALL
        allow for the application to be upgraded when the distributor 
        indicates that a newer version of the application is available.  System
        applications SHALL contain a version number.
      </p>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL be updated automatically.  This feature MAY 
        be disabled by a device owner.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Uninstallation</h3>
      <p>
        The execution environment SHALL allow all system applications to be  
        uninstalled.  However, an execution environment MAY prevent device 
        owners from uninstalling applications that were installed by a more 
        privileged device owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        An uninstalled system application SHALL NOT be executed by the user
        agent.  User data SHALL be deleted by a system application when it is 
        uninstalled only when that system application has indicated that this 
        is appropriate.  Applications are encouraged to gain consent from the 
        user where appropriate to avoid loss of data.
      </p>    
      <div class="note">
        E.g., a contact manager application, when uninstalled, shouldn't 
        necessarily delete all the user's contacts.
      </div>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>API Access Control</h2>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL access platform capabilities through a set of
        APIs as defined by the System Applications Working Group [[SysApps]].  
        The use of an API by an application SHALL require the application to
        have the corresponding permission, granted by the execution environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Application packages SHALL contain a list of the permissions that it 
        requires in order to function in the manner the developer intends. A 
        conformant execution environment SHALL follow the principle of least 
        privilege and provide a system application with <em>no more</em> than 
        the requested set of permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The execution environment MAY install an application without granting it
        the full set of permissions requested in the manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
        the execution environment SHALL store the permissions granted to an 
        application in an interoperable format and reload these permissions
        when an application instance is started.  Other privileged system 
        components or system applications MAY be granted permission to modify 
        these permissions but this permission SHALL NOT be given to system
        applications by default.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
        This document does not define the language or structure of how 
        permissions should be stored or processed by a execution environment.  
        However, the requirement to store and load permissions in an 
        interoperable way allows for use cases such as synchronising user 
        preferences between devices and allows system applications to be 
        managed by an operating system which may also control native 
        applications.  In the editor's view, the full security model 
        specification should go further and define the structure of permissions 
        (or at least the meta-model).

      <h2>Application Communication and Isolation</h2>
      <p>
        System applications operate in an isolated context with a unique origin 
        defined by their execution environment.  Unless requested by both applications, 
        a system application SHALL NOT be able to communicate with or access 
        the runtime content of another system application instance from a 
        different application package.  System application instances from
        the same package SHALL have the same origin and SHALL be able to 
        communicate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origin of a system application instance SHALL be distinct from any 
        other application from a different application package. An example
        can be found in [[WIDGETS-URI]] and is repeated here:
      </p>
      <p><code>widget://c13c6f30-ce25-11e0-9572-0800200c9a66</code></p>
      <div class="note">
        It seems necessary to define the 'origin' of a system application as
        the execution environment may be a browser operating in a different mode, e.g., a
        chrome browser running packaged applications.  However, there are no
        use cases for normal web applications interacting with system 
        applications so this does not seem to be an important part of the 
        document.  It is likely that system applications (particularly
        from the same author) will want to communicate with one another, though.
      </div>
           
      <h3>Communication access control and permissions</h3>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL define the applications they wish to 
        communicate with through the manifest.  
      </p>
      
      <h3>Communication between system applications</h3>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL communicate with other system applications on 
        the same host through <em>channel messaging</em> [[POSTMSG]].
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Runtime Environment</h2>
      <p>
        Because system applications are given access to more potentially 
        dangerous APIs and capabilities, the definition of a set of constraints
        on such applications is an opportunity to remove a whole class of 
        potential vulnerabilities.  This section defines how system applications
        are constrained beyond normal web applications.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
        It is recommended that CSP [[CSP]] be used to implement many of the 
        restrictions outlined in this document.  However, other 
        implementations such as WARP [[WARP]] may also be used.
      </div>
      
      <h3>Restrictions on JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL NOT be allowed to execute inline javascript
        nor shall they be able to execute string-to-JavaScript methods such as
        <code>eval</code> and <code>function</code>.
      </p>   
     
      <h3>Restrictions on Including Web Resources</h3>
      <p>
        To maintain the integrity of a system application, the execution environment 
        SHALL NOT allow an application to load external content from 
        non-whitelisted locations.  This includes images, CSS style sheets, 
        scripts, frames, fonts and other media. The definition of this content
        can be found in [[CSP]].
      </p>           
      <p>
        System applications SHALL be able to specify in their manifest the set 
        of remote locations for these resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the exception of images and other media content, all remote 
        locations defined in the manifest MUST have the protocol 
        <code>https:</code> or <code>wss:</code>.  Any remote locations defined in the manifest for
        non image or media sources which does not use the <code>https</code> or <code>wss:</code>
        protocol MUST be disregarded and not whitelisted.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        It is suggested, therefore, that the manifest contain a section defining
        the CSP policy for the application in this regard, although not CSP 
        statements which would violate the rest of this document. 
      </div>        
      
      <h3>Restrictions on Communicating with External Sources </h3>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL only be able to communicate using 
        XmlHttpRequests [[XHR]], WebSockets and EventSources only with URIs 
        explicitly defined in the manifest of the application and only if the 
        protocol of these URIs is <code>https:</code> or <code>wss:</code>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        System applications SHALL have an individual, isolated cookie store.  
        Two instances of applications from the same package SHALL share the 
        same store, but two instances of system applications from different
        packages SHALL NOT be able to access each other's cookies.
      </p>
      <h3>File API</h3>
      <p>
        System applications MAY be granted permission to access system files 
        through the File API [[FILE-API]].  
      </p>
      <p>  
        System applications SHALL be granted permission to read, write and 
        append to files stored in an isolated area unique to that application.  
        This storage SHALL NOT be shared with applications from different 
        application packages.  Execution environments SHALL provide encryption for this
        storage area in order to mitigate the threat to application data 
        when a device is stolen.  This capability MAY be turned off by a user.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Encrypted storage may take the form of full-disk encryption.
      </div>
      
      <h3>Disabled and modified features</h3>
      <p>
        System applications do not have access to the following features 
        provided by browsers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation history - window.history and window.location.</li>
        <li>Hyperlinks - hyperlinks to external websites should be opened 
        in a web browser rather than in the context of the system application.</li>
        <li>Third-party browser plugins. Man-in-the-browser threats could cause 
        code injection resulting in a security violation.  As such, third-party 
        browser plugins should be disabled in a systems applications context.</li>
        <li>Browser "chrome" APIs  (window.locationbar, window.menubar, 
        window.external, window,sidebar, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Monitoring and Interacting with Applications</h2>
      <p>
        In order to mitigate threats relating to the misuse of APIs by
        system applications, one countermeasure is to allow the underlying
        platform to monitor applications and what they are doing.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a system application may have permission to send an SMS
        message but the end user could be notified at the time that this is
        happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security-sensitive events invoked by system applications SHALL be 
        monitored by the execution environment and MAY trigger actions by 
        another system application or a native application.
